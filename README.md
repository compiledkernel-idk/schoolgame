# NEON RUSH
## Currency saves when exiting game


#### Important Notes

On **Windows** and **macOS**, the game may be flagged as coming from an "unidentified developer" or shown as a potential virus.  
This happens because the game is not code-signed with an official developer certificate.  

The game is safe to run — you can verify the source code here on GitHub and even build it yourself using Rust.  
If you encounter a warning:  

- On Windows: click "More info" → "Run anyway".  
- On macOS: right-click the app, choose "Open", then confirm.
